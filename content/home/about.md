# Biography

I'm a PhD student at MIT in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science working in CSAIL under the supervision of Professor Tamara Broderick in the Machine Learning Group. Before joining MIT for my graduate studies, I was a student at the Collegio Carlo Alberto and at the University of Torino, where I completed my master's thesis under the supervision of Igor Prünster and Pierpaolo de Blasi.

My current research interests are in machine learning, with an emphasis on hierarchical, nonparametric Bayesian models and network data.
