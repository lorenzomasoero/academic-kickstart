Ciao! I work as an Applied Research Scientist at Amazon. I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/), working in [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) under the supervision of [Tamara Broderick](http://www.tamarabroderick.com/) in 2021. My thesis developed novel Bayesian nonparametric methods for prediction and experimental design in the context of genomics studies. Before joining MIT, I was an Allievo student at the [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/) and at the [University of Torino](https://www.unito.it/). [Here](http://lorenzomasoero.com/files/cv_masoero_2022.pdf) you can find a copy of my CV. You can contact me via email at **lo** [dot] **masoero** at **gmail** dot **com**.
